# opus
This is my first project using a bootstrap framework.
it is 80% responsive but the modal feature for form is somehow buggy and would cut half way on bigger screens or in zoom.
The placeholder texts needs to be removed and the image grids needs to be worked on later on.
It  can be accessed on https://accessify.netlify.app/
